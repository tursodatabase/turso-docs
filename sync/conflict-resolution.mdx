description: How Turso sync handles concurrent changes from multiple clients.

<Note>
This particular usage uses the Turso Cloud to sync the local Turso databases and assumes that you have an account.

## Last Push Wins

Turso sync uses a **last push wins** strategy. When two clients modify the same data and push, the last push determines the final state on the remote.

| Time | Client A | Client B |
|------|----------|----------|
| T1 | `UPDATE users SET name='Alice' WHERE id=1` | |
| T2 | | `UPDATE users SET name='Bob' WHERE id=1` |
| T3 | `push()` | |
| T4 | | `push()` |

**Result**: The name is `'Bob'` because Client B pushed last.

## What Happens During Pull

When you pull and have unpushed local changes:

1. Your local database is rolled back to the last synced state
2. Remote changes are applied
3. Your unpushed local changes are **replayed** on top

This rollback-and-replay happens atomically — if anything fails, your database remains in its previous state.
