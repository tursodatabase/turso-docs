![Turso Quickstart](/images/turso-banner.png)

In this quickstart you will learn how to:

- Install the Turso CLI
- Signup to Turso
- Create your first Turso Database
- Connect to Database Shell
- Replicate Database to another region

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the Turso CLI">

We'll be using the Turso CLI throughout this quickstart to manage databases, create replicas in other regions, and connect to the database shell.

<CodeGroup>

```bash macOS
brew install tursodatabase/tap/turso
```

```bash Linux
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

```bash Windows
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Signup to Turso">

The next command will open your browser to sign in with GitHub:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Signup
turso auth signup
```

```bash Login
turso auth login
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Create a Database">

Now create your first database in a location closest to you with the name `my-db`:

```bash
turso db create my-db
```

The Turso CLI automatically detected your closest region to create a database. It used this location to create a `default` "group" for your database, which you can inspect using the following command:

```bash
turso db show my-db
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect to Database Shell">

Congratulations, you created a database! Now connect to it with the `shell` command:

```bash
turso db shell my-db
```

<Info>

Replace `my-db` with the name of your database if you named it differently.

</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create table">
    Now create a table for `users` using SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT
);
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insert into new table">

Then insert a row into the `users` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ("Iku");
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Select all rows from table">
    
    Finally, query for all `users`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

When you're ready to move onto the next step, you'll want to to quit the shell:

```sql
.quit
```

</Step>

<Step title="Replicate Database to another region">

Adding a database replica is an easy as adding another location to the "group" your database belongs to.

First, you can fetch a list of supported locations using the Turso CLI:

```bash
turso db locations
```

Pick a location for your database to replicate it to and pass the three-digit code to the `groups locations add` command:

```bash
turso group locations add default nrt
```

**Congratulations**! Your data is now replicated and closer to users in two regions.

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your application your database">

You're now ready to connect your application to your database. Pick from one of the SDKs below to continue:
