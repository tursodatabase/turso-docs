**In this quickstart you will learn how to:**

1. Install the Turso CLI
2. Signup to Turso Cloud
3. Create your first Turso Cloud database
4. Connect to Database Shell

<Steps>

<Step title="Install the Turso CLI">

We'll be using the Turso CLI throughout this quickstart to manage databases and connect to the database shell.

<CodeGroup>

```bash macOS
brew install tursodatabase/tap/turso
```

```bash Linux
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

```bash Windows (WSL)
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Signup to Turso Cloud">

The next command will open your browser to sign up:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Signup
turso auth signup
```

```bash Login
turso auth login
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Create a Database">

Now create your first database with the name `my-db`:

```bash
turso db create my-db
```

You can inspect your new database using the following command:

```bash
turso db show my-db
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect to Database Shell">

Congratulations, you created a database! Now connect to it with the `shell` command:

```bash
turso db shell my-db
```

<Info>

Replace `my-db` with the name of your database if you named it differently.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create table">
    Now create a table for `users` using SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT
);
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insert into new table">

Then insert a row into the `users` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ("Iku");
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Select all rows from table">

    Finally, query for all `users`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

When you're ready to move onto the next step, you'll want to to quit the shell:

```sql
.quit
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect your application to your database">
