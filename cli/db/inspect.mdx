## Examples

### Top Queries

You can fetch the most executed, resource-intensive SQL statements that have been run against your database using the Turso CLI:

```bash
turso db inspect <database-name> --queries
```

The response will contain the query and rows read/written that looks something like this:

```bash
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Status = 'Pending';
SELECT COUNT(*), CustomerID FROM Orders GROUP BY CustomerID HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
UPDATE Products SET Price = Price * 1.10 WHERE Category = 'Electronics';
```
