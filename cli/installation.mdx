---

## macOS

To install the Turso CLI on macOS, we recommend that you use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install tursodatabase/tap/turso
```

If you don't use Homebrew, you can use the following command to execute a shell script that installs the CLI:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

## Linux

Run the following command to execute a shell script that installs the CLI:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

## Windows

Installing the Turso CLI on Windows requires that you have [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed.

> **_NOTE:_**
Starting from Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu on WSL no longer bundles wslu by default.
If you don't install it, certain commands such as turso auth login may fail with the error:
'Error: failed to open auth URL: exec: "xdg-open,x-www-browser,www-browser": executable file not found in $PATH'
To fix this, install wslu from its official PPA: <br>
  `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wslutilities/wslu` <br>
  `sudo apt update` <br>
  `sudo apt install wslu` <br>

Once WSL is installed, run the following in PowerShell:

```bash
wsl
```

You can then execute the script to install the Turso CLI:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

## Verify installation

You must open a new shell to verify the installation with the following command:

```bash
turso
```
