You can create a new group of databases. Groups belong to a primary region and can be replicated to other regions.

```bash
turso group create <group-name> [flags]
```

<Warning>Creating more than one group is limited to paid plans.</Warning>

<Info>

Turso will automatically detect the closest region and use that as the primary region. You can override this by specifying the `--location` flag.
