## `login`

The Turso CLI uses an access token to authenticate with Turso. You can login using the command:

```bash
turso auth login
```

This will open a browser window, asking you to log into your account with GitHub.

<Note>

If you're using Windows with WSL or a remote CI/CD environment, pass the `--headless` flag.

</Note>

Once you're logged in, you can manage your account and databases. You can explore all of the commands via the docs, or by using the `--help` flag for each subcommand:

```bash
turso
```

<Info>

The Turso CLI requires you to reauthenticate after one week. Don't share your token.
