title: Authentication
---

The Turso CLI uses an access token to authenticate with Turso. You can login using the command:

```bash
turso auth token
```

This will open a browser window, asking you to log into your account with GitHub.

Once you're logged in, you can manage your account and databases. You can explore all of the commands via the docs, or by using the `--help` flag for each subcommand:

```bash
turso
```

<Info>

The Turso CLI requires you to reauthenticate after one week. Don't share your token.
