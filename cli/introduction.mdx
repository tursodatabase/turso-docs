The Turso CLI gives you everything you need from the command line to manage your database, database replicas, API tokens, inviting users, and launching the database shell. If you're waiting for a migration to run, there's also a relax command.

You can also programmatically manage your Turso account, including groups, databases, organizations and invites using the [Platform API](/api-reference).
