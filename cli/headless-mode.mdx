title: Headless Mode
---

The Turso CLI will automatically attempt to open a browser, or wait for further instructions when interacting with various commands.

You can opt out of this behaviour by passing the `--headless` flag with operations:

```bash
turso auth login --headless
```

<Note>

If you're using Windows with WSL or a remote CI/CD environment, pass the `--headless` flag.
