## Database

Each database is equipped with its own schema and data, situated in a primary location along with possibly several replica locations within its designated [group](#groups). This setup ensures that the schema and data are seamlessly copied from the primary location to all replica sites in the group.

Databases are identified by a distinct libSQL URL. When accessed through the libSQL client SDKs, this URL directs the client to the database instance that offers the lowest latency, thereby reducing the overall duration of read operations.

### Schema Database

Turso provides a feature called [Multi-DB Schemas](/features/multi-db-schemas) that let you share schema across many databases in a group. This is useful for creating a multi-tenant application where each tenant has their own database.

## Instance

A database instance represents a single element of a logical database situated at a specific location.

This instance operates under a managed libSQL server setup hosted on an individual machine. Instances belonging to various logical databases within the same [group](#groups) are managed by a single libSQL server process running on the same piece of hardware.

Instances are categorized into two types: primary and replica.

## Groups

All databases are part of a "group", dictating their primary storage location and replication across distinct VMs ([locations](/cloud-providers#locations)), each replica (volume) is capped at 100GB. This setup ensures databases share resources yet remain isolated.

<Note>Enterprise plans can have higher limits on storage.</Note>

<Warning>
  Creating more than one group is limited to Scaler, Pro and Enterprise plans.
  You can add additional groups if you have overages enabled.
