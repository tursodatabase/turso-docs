## Locations

Turso optimizes data access with control over data storage and replication across global locations. Your databases form a [group](#groups) with a primary and optional replica locations, ensuring low latency. Turso handles synchronization automatically across its [data edge](/data-edge).

- **Primary**
  - All databases have a primary location (region) where data is stored, and can't be changed. You can configure the primary location for groups using the Turso CLI and Turso Platform API.
- **Replicas**
  - Databases can be replicated to other regions closer to your users by adding more locations to the group your database belongs to.

You can fetch the list of supported located as JSON when building with the [Platform API](/api-reference/locations) or using the [Turso CLI](/cli/db/locations).

## Groups

All databases are part of a "group", dictating their primary storage location and replication across distinct VMs (locations), each capped at 100GB. This setup ensures databases share resources yet remain isolated.
