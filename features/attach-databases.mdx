- [ ] Document what ATTACH is and enables
- [ ] Create `cli/attach` page with the CLI Quickstart below

## CLI Quickstart

TODO: Refactor this slightly

<Steps>

<Step title="Enable attach on required databases">

You will first need to enable the `attach` feature on the databases you want to connect to:

```bash
turso db config attach allow <database-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve database ID">

You now need to retrieve the **Database ID** for the database you want to `ATTACH`:

```bash
turso db show <database-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect to any database with attach">

Now pass the names of the databases to the `--attach` flag when connecting to a database:

```bash
turso db shell <database-name> --attach <...database-name(s)-from-step-1>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Invoke ATTACH inside the shell">

Now once connected to the shell you can invoke `ATTACH` to connect to the other databases:

```sql
ATTACH "<database-id>" AS my_db;
```

</Step>

<Step title="Query from an attached database">

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_db.my_table;
```

</Step>

</Steps>
