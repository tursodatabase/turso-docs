title: Attach Database
description: Attach and read data across multiple databases.
---

The `ATTACH` command allows you to connect to multiple databases within a single transaction. This is useful for reading data from multiple databases within a single query.

Using the `ATTACH` command is great for a variety of use cases, including:

- Modular data organization
- Simplified data access and scalability
- Schema management
- Data aggregation

TODO

- Create `cli/attach` page with the CLI Quickstart below
- Create `ATTACH` sections inside of each reference for usage instructions with tokens

## How it works

1. You enable the `attach` feature on the databases you want to connect to.
2. You retrieve the **Database ID** for the database you want to `ATTACH`.
3. You connect to the database
   - You can use the Turso CLI or a libSQL SDK to connect to the database.
   - CLI uses the `--attach` flag to automatically create a token with the correct permissions.
   - SDKs require you to create a token with the `attach` permission for the database you want to attach.
4. You invoke `ATTACH` to connect to the other databases within the database shell or SDK.

## Usage

### Turso CLI

TODO: Refactor this slightly

<Steps>

<Step title="Enable attach on required databases">

You will first need to enable the `attach` feature on the databases you want to connect to:

```bash
turso db config attach allow <database-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve database ID">

You now need to retrieve the **Database ID** for the database you want to `ATTACH`:

```bash
turso db show <database-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect to any database with attach">

Now pass the names of the databases to the `--attach` flag when connecting to a database:

```bash
turso db shell <database-name> --attach <...database-name(s)-from-step-1>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Invoke ATTACH inside the shell">

Now once connected to the shell you can invoke `ATTACH` to connect to the other databases:

```sql
ATTACH "<database-id>" AS my_db;
```

</Step>

<Step title="Query from an attached database">

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_db.my_table;
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### libSQL SDKs

TODO: Refactor this slightly

<Steps>

<Step title="Enable attach on required databases">

You will first need to enable the `attach` feature on the databases you want to connect to:

```bash
turso db config attach allow <database-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve database ID">

You now need to retrieve the **Database ID** for the database you want to `ATTACH`:

```bash
turso db show <database-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create token with attach permissions">

Now create a token for the libSQL client with the `attach` permission for the database you want to attach:

```bash
turso db tokens create <database-name> --attach <another-database-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Connect to any database with attach">

Now you can use a [Client SDK](/sdk/) to attach the desired database within a read transaction:

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: process.env.LIBSQL_URL,
  authToken: process.env.LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN,
});

const txn = await db.transaction("read");

await txn.execute('ATTACH "<database-id-from-previous-step>" AS <some-name>');

const rs = await txn.execute("SELECT * FROM <some-name>.t");
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Limitations

- You can only attach databases that have the `attach` feature enabled.
- You can only attach databases in the same database group.
- There is a maximum of 128 databases that can be attached to a single transaction.
- `ATTACH` only supports read-only transactions. You cannot `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` data from an attached database.
