## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

- [Install the Turso CLI](/cli/installation)
- [Sign up or login to Turso Cloud](/cli/authentication#signup)
- Have an Akamai account - [create one](https://login.linode.com/signup)

<Steps>

<Step title="Retrieve database credentials">

You will need an existing database to continue. If you don't have one, [create one](/quickstart).

<Snippet file="retrieve-database-credentials.mdx" />

<Info>You will want to store these as environment variables.</Info>

</Step>

<Step>
    Fork one of the following embedded replica projects from GitHub

</Step>

<Step title="Set up a Linode server">

Configure and create a new linode. Then, [set up SSH authentication](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) to securely access the Linode server from your terminal.

Prepare the newly created linode server environment by accessing and set it up for Rust/JavaScript development depending on the project you forked earlier. Install and set up [Git](https://git-scm.com/) too.

</Step>

<Step title="Transfer project to Linode server">

SSH into your server, clone the project from GitHub, and follow its README instructions to set it up.

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy">

Build, run the project, and set up load balancing for it.
[pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) is one of the good candidates out there with built-in load balancing, log monitoring, and bug/exception alerts.

<Info>
You can go with your favorite options for where to buy domains, reverse proxy setup, and SSL certificates. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is another good option here.
