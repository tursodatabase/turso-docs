<Step title="Set up a Linode server">

1. Set up and create a linode.

2. [set up SSH authentication](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/) to securely access the Linode server from your terminal.

3. Access the server and set it up for Rust/JavaScript development, depending on the project you forked earlier. Install and set up [Git](https://git-scm.com/) too.

</Step>

<Step title="Transfer project to Linode server">

1. SSH into your project.

2. Clone project from GitHub.

3. Use the project's README instructions to set it up.

</Step>

<Step title="Deploy">

1. Build and run the project

2. Set up load balancing for you project. [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) is one of the good candidates out there with built-in load balancing, logs monitoring, and bugs/exceptions alerts.
