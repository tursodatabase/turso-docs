## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

- [Install the Turso CLI](/cli/installation)
- [Sign up or login to Turso Cloud](/cli/authentication#signup)
- [Install the Fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

<Steps>

  <Step title="Locate your application">

You should have an application ready using your Turso Cloud database that you want to deploy to Fly.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch with Fly">

Using the Fly CLI, launch it:

```bash
fly launch
```

Your application will automatically deploy to Fly, but we're not ready yet.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a shared volume">

Now create a volume that will be used to store the embedded replica(s):

```bash
fly volumes create libsql_data
```

  </Step>

    <Step title="Mount and configure volumes">

The files `fly.toml` and `Dockerfile` created created when you launched previously.

Update `fly.toml` this file to mount the new volume:

```toml
[[mounts]]
source = "libsql_data"
destination = "/app/data"
```

Then inside `Dockerfile`, make sure you install and update `ca-certificates`:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update -qq && \
    apt-get install -y ca-certificates && \
    update-ca-certificates
```

Make sure to also add the following line after any `COPY` commands to copy the certificates:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=build /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
```

    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure the libSQL client">

    You will want to change the `url` to point to a local file, and set the `syncUrl` to be your Turso Cloud database URL:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "file:/app/data/local.db",
  syncUrl: process.env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL,
  authToken: process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN,
  syncInterval: 60,
});
```

    </Step>

    <Step title="Deploy your updated app">

```bash
fly deploy
```

    </Step>

</Steps>
