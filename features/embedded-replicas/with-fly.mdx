## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

- [Install the Turso CLI](/cli/installation)
- [Sign up or login to Turso](/cli/authentication#signup)
- [Install the Fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

<Steps>

<Step title="Retrieve database credentials">

You will need an existing database to continue. If you don't have one, [create one](/quickstart).

<Snippet file="retrieve-database-credentials.mdx" />

<Info>You will want to store these as environment variables.</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Get application code">
    Fork and clone the following embedded replica project from GitHub locally:

        icon="github"
        href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/embedded-replicas-with-js"
    >
    See the full source code
    </Card>

    <Info>
    You can use [Fly's dockerfile generation package](https://github.com/fly-apps/dockerfile-node#overview) to create a Dockerfile for your own project.
    </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Launch your application on Fly">
Run the following command from your project root directory to launch your application on fly:

```sh
fly launch
```

Fly will give you the default configurations for your app which you are free to update.

```sh
Organization: Turso                         (fly launch defaults to the personal org)
Name:         embedded-replicas-with-nodejs (derived from your directory name)
Region:       Johannesburg, South Africa    (this is the fastest region for you)
App Machines: shared-cpu-1x, 1GB RAM        (most apps need about 1GB of RAM)
Postgres:     <none>                        (not requested)
Redis:        <none>                        (not requested)
Sentry:       false                         (not requested)
```

On completion, you'll have Fly configuration file `fly.toml` added to your project.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Secrets to Fly">

Add the database and other credentials needed in your application as Fly secrets:

```sh
fly secrets set TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://[db-name]-[github-username].turso.io
fly secrets set TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
fly secrets set LOCAL_DB=file:dbs/expenses.db
fly secrets set HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
fly secrets set SECRET=...
fly secrets set PORT=3000
```
</Step>

<Step>
Deploy your fly application.

```sh
fly deploy
```
</Step>
