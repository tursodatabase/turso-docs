title: Data Edge (Deprecated)
description: Allow your users to reach local replicas of your database, wherever they are.

<Warning>
  This feature is now deprecated for all new users. Existing users can continue
  to use Edge Replicas on Fly &mdash; [read the
  announcement](/upcoming-changes-to-the-turso-platform-and-roadmap)
</Warning>

In the realm of data management, each millisecond of latency is critical. That's why Turso offers over [30 locations](/cloud-providers#locations) for data storage and replication, ensuring minimal delay in data access.

For those seeking the ultimate in speed, Turso enables the [embedding of databases](/features/embedded-replicas) directly within your application on the same node. This configuration eliminates inter-regional request hopping, effectively bringing latency down to zero.

## How it works

1. You create a database in a primary location
2. You add additional locations where data should be replicated
3. You query a single URL that automatically routes to the nearest edge

<Info>

Turso automatically handles keeping replicas updated &mdash; [learn more](/data-and-connections).

## Add replica location

You can add locations to your database group using the [Turso CLI](/cli/group/locations/add) or [Platform API](/api-reference/groups/add-location):

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
turso group locations add <group-name> <location-code>
```

```bash Platform API
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.turso.tech/v1/organizations/{organizationSlug}/groups/{groupName}/locations/{location}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Remove replica location

You can remove locations from your database group using the [Turso CLI](/cli/group/locations/remove) or [Platform API](/api-reference/groups/remove-location):

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI
turso group locations remove <group-name> <...location-codes>
```

```bash Platform API
curl -L -X DELETE 'https://api.turso.tech/v1/organizations/{organizationSlug}/groups/{groupName}/locations/{location}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
```

</CodeGroup>
