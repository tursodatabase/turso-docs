description: Vector Similarity Search is built into Turso and libSQL Server as a native datatype.
---

Turso enables vector search without an extension, it's just another datatype in SQLite.

<Snippet file="technical-preview-banner.mdx" />


## How to use

- Use `F32_BLOB` / `FLOAT32` type names to define vector table column
- Use `vector` function to convert vector in string representation into the binary format
- Use `vector_extract` function to extract string representation from vector in binary format
- Use `vector_distance_cos` function to calculate cosine distance between two vectors
- Use `libsql_vector_idx(emb)` expression in the `CREATE INDEX` statement to create ANN-index
- Use `vector_top_k(idx_name, q_vector, k)` [table-valued function](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#table_valued_functions) to query ANN-index
- Vectors are available for groups with the libSQL Server `vector` version
  - Command to change group version: `turso db upgrade <group> --version vector`

## Usage

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a table">

Begin by declaring a column used for storing vectors with the `F32_BLOB` datatype:

```sql {4}
CREATE TABLE movies (
  title TEXT,
  year INT,
  embedding F32_BLOB(3) -- 3-dimensional f32 vector
);
```

The number in parentheses (3) specifies the dimensionality of the vector. This means each vector in this column will have exactly 3 components.

</Step>

<Step title="Generate and insert embeddings">

Once you generate embeddings for your data (via an LLM), you can insert them into your table:

```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, year, embedding)
VALUES
  ( 'Napoleon', 2023, vector('[1,2,3]')),
  ( 'Black Hawk Down', 2001, vector('[10,11,12]')),
  ( 'Gladiator', 2000, vector('[7,8,9]')),
  ( 'Blade Runner', 1982, vector('[4,5,6]'));
```

Popular tools like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) or [OpenAI](https://turso.tech/blog/how-to-generate-and-store-openai-vector-embeddings-with-turso) can be used to generate embeddings.

</Step>

<Step title="Peform a vector similarity search">

You can now write queries combining vectors and standard SQLite data:

```sql
SELECT title,
       vector_extract(embedding),
       vector_distance_cos(embedding, vector('[5,6,7]'))
FROM movies;
```

<Note>
The `vector_distance_cos` function calculates the cosine **distance**, which equals to 1 - [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). Therefore, a smaller distance indicates that the vectors are closer to each other.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Combine regular table data with vector search">

You can combine vector search with regular query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
  movies
WHERE
  year >= 2020
ORDER BY
  vector_distance_cos(embedding, '[3,1,2]')
LIMIT 3;
```

This query demonstrates how to combine traditional SQL filtering (`year >= 2020`) with vector similarity search.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Indexing

Turso implements **Approximate Nearest Neighbors** (ANN) using the DiskANN algorithm for larger datasets.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create an Index">

Create an index using the `libsql_vector_idx` function:

```sql
CREATE INDEX movies_idx ON movies ( libsql_vector_idx(embedding) );
```

This creates an index optimized for vector similarity searches on the `embedding` column.

<Note>
The `libsql_vector_idx` marker function is **required** and used by libSQL to distinguish `ANN`-indices from ordinary B-Tree indices.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Query the indexed table">

```sql
SELECT title, year FROM vector_top_k('movies_idx', vector('[4,5,6]'), 3)
JOIN movies ON movies.rowid = id
WHERE year >= 2020;

-- alternatively, you can just filter results with IN operator
SELECT title, year FROM movies
WHERE rowid IN vector_top_k('movies_idx', vector('[4,5,6]'), 3) AND
      year >= 2020;
```

This query uses the `vector_top_k` [table-valued function](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#table_valued_functions) to efficiently find the top 3 most similar vectors to `[4,5,6]` using the index.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Things to know

- Internall ANN-index use `rowid` as an identifier for rows in base table instead of natural `PRIMARY KEY`.
- Vectors are stored as an SQLite `BLOB` using the `vector` function.
