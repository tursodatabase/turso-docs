title: Multi-DB Schemas
description: Create and share a single schema across multiple databases.
---

Turso allows you to create a single schema and share it across multiple databases. This is useful for creating a multi-tenant application where each tenant has their own database.

<Warning>

This feature is currently in beta. [Join us in Discord](https://discord.gg/turso) to provide feedback and report any issues.

</Warning>

<Info>

Try the [Turso Platforms Starter](https://github.com/notrab/turso-platforms-starter) to get started with a multi-tenant application using Next.js, Drizzle, Clerk, libSQL, and Turso Multi-DB Schemas.

</Info>

## How it works

1. You create a database that is used as the parent schema database.
2. You create one or more databases that are used as the child databases.
3. You apply schema changes to the parent database, child databases are automatically updated with the new schema.

## Usage

You can create and manage parent or child databases using the [Turso CLI](/cli/db/create), and [Platform API](/api-reference/databases/create).

### Turso CLI

Make sure you have the [Turso CLI](/cli/installation) installed, and [logged in](/cli/auth/login).

<Steps>

<Step title="Create Parent Database">

Create a single database using the `--type` flag set to `schema`:

```bash
turso db create parent-db --type schema
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create Schema">

Connect to your database using the shell to `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE TRIGGER`, `CREATE VIEW`, and anything else to setup your schema:

```bash
turso db shell parent-db
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create Child Database(s)">

Create one or more child databases using the `--schema` flag with the name of the parent database:

```bash
turso db create child-db --schema parent-db
```

</Step>

<Step title="Apply Additional Schema Changes">

You can now apply additional schema changes to the parent database, and the child databases will be automatically updated:

```bash
turso db shell parent-db "CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);"
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### Platform API

Make sure you have an API Token, and know your Organization name:

<Steps>

<Step title="Create Parent Database">

Create a database and set the `is_schema` field to `true`:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.turso.tech/v1/organizations/{organizationName}/databases' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "name": "parent-db",
      "group": "default",
      "is_schema": true
  }'
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create Schema">

Connect to your database using the shell, [SDK](/sdk), or migration script to `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE TRIGGER`, `CREATE VIEW`, and anything else to setup your schema:

```bash Turso CLI
turso db shell parent-db
```

</Step>

<Step title="Create Child Database(s)">

Create one or more child databases and pass the `schema` field the name of your parent database:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.turso.tech/v1/organizations/{organizationName}/databases' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "name": "child-db",
      "group": "default",
      "schema": "parent-db"
  }'
```

</Step>

<Step title="Apply Additional Schema Changes">

You can now apply additional schema changes to the parent database, and the child databases will be automatically updated:

```bash
turso db shell parent-db "CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);"
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Things to know

- Schema databases cannot be shared across groups or globally via an organization/account.
- You can `INSERT` rows into the parent database that can be querified by the child database(s).
  - Be aware of any constraints that may conflict with the child database(s).
- You can't delete a parent database if it has one or more child databases.
- You can't create or delete a database if there are any migrations running.
  - Make sure any application querying the child databases handle any databases not yet updated with the schema.
