description: Manage databases, replicas, and teams with the Turso Platform API.
---

The Turso [Platform API](/api-reference) is a RESTful API that allows you to manage databases, replicas, and users. It is the same API that is used by the Turso Platform Web UI and [CLI](/cli).

The API is built for platforms that want to integrate with Turso to provide their users a globally distributed database, without managing database infrastructure and replication.

You can create databases, [database branches](/features/branching), [recover databases](/features/point-in-time-recovery) from a point in time, as well as [manage teams](/features/organizations), API tokens, and more with the Turso Platform API.
