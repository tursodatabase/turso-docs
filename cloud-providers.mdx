## Fly

You can deploy and replicate to many locations on Fly. Your databases form a [group](#groups) with a primary and optional replica locations. Turso handles synchronization from the primary to replicas automatically across its [data edge](/features/data-edge).

- **Primary**
  - All databases have a primary location (region) where data is stored, and can't be changed. You can configure the primary location for groups using the Turso CLI and Turso Platform API.
- **Replicas**
  - Databases can be replicated to other regions closer to your users by adding more locations to the group your database belongs to.
