AgentFS lets you run AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode in a sandboxed environment where file changes are isolated from your original source tree.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Command |
|-------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) | `agentfs run claude` |
| [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) | `agentfs run codex` |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) | `agentfs run opencode` |
| Any CLI tool | `agentfs run <command>` |

## Workflow

Here's a typical agentic coding workflow. This example uses Claude Code, but the workflow is the same with OpenCode, Codex, and others.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the git repository to a host directory. Keep this source tree clean from build artifacts. When there's a merge to main, pull to this repository to keep it up-to-date.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tursodatabase/agentfs.git
cd agentfs
```

### Step 2: Start an AgentFS Session

Use `agentfs run` with the `--session` flag to start a session. Pick a name that can eventually become your git branch name.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```bash
    agentfs run --session fix-bug-123 claude
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Codex">
    ```bash
    agentfs run --session fix-bug-123 codex
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OpenCode">
    ```bash
    agentfs run --session fix-bug-123 opencode
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The agent now runs in a copy-on-write environment. Your original source tree remains untouched while the agent works.

### Step 3 (Optional): Manual Investigation

If the agent does something unusual, open another terminal and join the same session to investigate:

```bash
agentfs run --session fix-bug-123 bash
```

The filesystem is shared between the shell and the agent. You can browse files, run tests, or check what's happening while the agent works.

### Step 4: Push to Branch

Once the agent has completed the work, ask it to create a branch, commit the code, and push:

> "Create a branch called fix-bug-123, commit these changes, and push to origin"

You can then create a PR manually from the pushed branch.

## Why This Workflow?

- **Clean source tree** - Your original clone stays pristine and easy to update from upstream
- **Isolated changes** - Each task gets its own session, preventing cross-contamination
- **Easy investigation** - Join any session to see what's happening in real-time
- **Standard git flow** - Push branches and create PRs as usual
