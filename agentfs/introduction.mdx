AgentFS is a filesystem for AI agents. It provides copy-on-write isolation, letting agents safely modify files while keeping your original data untouched.

## Key Features

- **Copy-on-Write Isolation** — Run agents in sandboxed environments where changes are isolated from your source tree
- **Single File Storage** — Everything stored in one portable SQLite database
- **Built-in Auditing** — Every file operation is recorded and queryable
- **Cloud Sync** — Optionally sync agent state to Turso Cloud

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://github.com/tursodatabase/agentfs/releases/latest/download/agentfs-installer.sh | sh

# Run a shell in an isolated environment
cd /path/to/project
agentfs run bash

# Any changes are isolated - your original files are safe
```
