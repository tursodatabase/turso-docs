description: A filesystem and state management SDK for AI agents, built on Turso
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

AgentFS is a specialized filesystem and state management SDK designed for AI agents. It provides a complete, queryable, and portable solution for managing agent state, files, and interactions—all powered by Turso's embedded database technology.

## Why AgentFS?

Building reliable AI agents requires solving fundamental challenges:

- **State Management**: Agents need persistent memory across sessions
- **Auditability**: Every action must be traceable for debugging and compliance
- **Reproducibility**: Agent states must be snapshottable and restorable
- **Simplicity**: Complex distributed systems shouldn't be required for agent development

AgentFS solves these challenges with a single, portable database file that contains your entire agent runtime.

## Core Capabilities

### 🗄️ Unified Storage
Everything your agent needs—files, state, history—stored in a single database file. No complex infrastructure, just one file you can query, backup, or move.

### 🔍 Built-in Auditability
Every filesystem operation, state change, and tool call is automatically recorded. Query your agent's behavior with SQL:

```sql
-- Find all web searches performed by the agent
SELECT * FROM toolcalls
WHERE name = 'web_search'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Analyze file modifications
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE type = 'file_write'
AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-1 hour');
```

### 🔄 State Reproducibility
Snapshot agent states at any point and restore them later. Perfect for:
- Debugging complex agent behaviors
- Testing different execution paths
- Creating checkpoints in long-running workflows

### 📦 Portability
Move your entire agent between environments with a single file. Development to production, cloud to edge—your agent's complete state travels with it.

## Architecture

AgentFS provides three main interfaces:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AI Agent] --> B[AgentFS SDK]
    B --> C[Filesystem API]
    B --> D[Key-Value API]
    B --> E[Tool Call API]
    C --> F[Turso Database]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

All operations are atomic and transactional, ensuring data consistency even during failures.

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { AgentFS } from 'agentfs-sdk';

// Open or create an agent filesystem
const agent = await AgentFS.open(
  './my-agent.db'
);

// Store agent configuration
await agent.kv.set('agent:config', {
  model: 'gpt-4',
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 2000
});

// Write generated content
await agent.fs.writeFile(
  '/outputs/report.md',
  reportContent
);

// Track tool usage
await agent.tools.record(
  'generate_report',
  startTime,
  endTime,
  { topic: 'Q4 Analysis' },
  { success: true, pages: 15 }
);

// Query the agent's work
const recentFiles = await agent.fs.readdir('/outputs');
const toolHistory = await agent.tools.list({ limit: 10 });
```
