Turso is the small database to power your big dreams in the age of AI. The most efficient way to build for traditional applications, smart devices, embodied AI, agents, and anything in between.

## Turso Database

An embedded database engine that goes anywhere. Offline, in the browser, or on-device â€” **the next evolution of SQLite.**

- **Vector Search** â€” Native similarity search for AI apps and RAG workflows, no extensions required.
- **Async Design** â€” Modern async primitives such as Linux `io_uring` to keep your apps responsive.
- **Concurrent Writes** (soon) â€” Multiple writers, zero conflicts, without locking.
- **Observability** (soon) â€” Out of the box with open telemetry integration.
- **SQLite Compatible** â€” Fully backwards compatible SQLite, but built for the next generation of agents.
- **Open Contribution** â€” Take your seat at the table and contribute to the next evolution of SQLite.
