libSQL is a fork of SQLite, created because SQLite is [open-source but not open-contribution](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html). libSQL is production-ready, fully backwards compatible with SQLite, and adds features like native vector search.

<Note>
  libSQL represents where we started. Today, our focus is [Turso Database](/tursodb/quickstart), a full rewrite of SQLite built from scratch, designed for the highest density of databases with no need for servers or connectivity. If you're starting a new project, we recommend [Turso Database](/tursodb/quickstart). For mission-critical workloads that need a battle-tested foundation today, libSQL is the right choice.

## libSQL vs. Turso Database

libSQL is a fork of SQLite. It maintains the same file format, the same API, and full backwards compatibility. It extends SQLite with features the ecosystem has long needed but couldn't contribute upstream.

[Turso Database](/tursodb/quickstart) is a different approach: a ground-up rewrite of SQLite. It reimplements SQLite's semantics with a modern architecture designed for concurrent writes, async I/O, and the highest database density in the industry.

| | libSQL | Turso Database |
|---|---|---|
| Approach | Fork of SQLite | Full rewrite of SQLite |
| Maturity | Production-ready | Evolving (beta) |
| SQLite compatibility | Full (same file format and API) | Backwards compatible |
| Best for | Mission-critical workloads today | New projects, agents, smart devices, high-density use cases |

Both are open-contribution and maintained by Turso. [Turso Cloud](/turso-cloud) currently runs on libSQL and will integrate the Turso Database engine in the future.

## Extensions

<Info>
  If you're looking to enable vector extensions, you should instead consider
  using the native [libSQL vector datatype](/features/ai-and-embeddings).

A full list of supported extensions can be found [here](/features/sqlite-extensions).
