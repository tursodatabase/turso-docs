The Turso API uses API tokens to authenticate requests. You can create and revoke API tokens using the [Turso CLI](/cli) and [Authentication API](/api-reference/api-tokens).

API tokens allow access to manage all API resources, including creating and destroying database.

- Use environment variables when working with API tokens.
- Never share your API token in public, including repositories, and CI/CD Actions.

Turso uses Bearer authentication, and requires your API token to be passed with all protected requests in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
```

## Base URL

The Turso API is located at the following URL:

```bash
