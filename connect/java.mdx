<Steps>

<Step title="Install">

Currently, we have not published to the maven central. Instead, you can locally build the jar and deploy it to maven local to use it.

Build jar and publish to maven local:

```bash
cd bindings/java

# Please select the appropriate target platform, currently supports `macos_x86`, `macos_arm64`, `windows` and `linux_x86`
make macos_x86

# deploy to maven local
make publish_local
```

Now you can use the dependency as follows:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("tech.turso:turso:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

</Step>
