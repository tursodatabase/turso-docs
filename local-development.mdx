title: Local Development
description: Build locally using SQLite, libSQL Server or Turso.
---

Developers can build locally with Turso using either of the following methods:

- [SQLite](#sqlite) &mdash; local SQLite database file
- [Turso CLI](#turso-cli) &mdash; managed libSQL server
- [libSQL Server](#libsql-server) &mdash; self managed libSQL server
- [Turso Database](#turso-database) &mdash; remote Turso database

## Using a dump locally

You can always dump your production database and use it locally for development:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a dump using the Turso CLI">

```bash
turso db shell your-database .dump > dump.sql
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create SQLite file from dump">

```bash
cat dump.sql | sqlite3 local.db
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to SQLite file">

    You can use any of the methods below with the `local.db` file, or you can use a new file name if you prefer to create a database from scratch.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## SQLite

There are a few things to keep in mind when using SQLite for local development:

- Doesn't have all the features of libSQL
- Works with non-serverless based Turso SDKs

When working with an [SDK](/sdk), you can pass it a `file:` URL to connect to a SQLite database file instead of a remote Turso database:

<CodeGroup>

```ts JavaScript
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "file:local.db",
});
```

```rust Rust
let client = libsql_client::Client::from_config(libsql_client::Config {
    url: url::Url::parse("file:local.db").unwrap(),
    auth_token: None,
})
.await
.unwrap();
```

```go Go
package main

import (
  "database/sql"
  "fmt"
  "os"

  _ "github.com/tursodatabase/go-libsql"
)

func main() {
  dbName := "file:./local.db"

  db, err := sql.Open("libsql", dbName)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "failed to open db %s", err)
    os.Exit(1)
  }
  defer db.Close()
}
```

```python Python
import libsql_client

client = libsql_client.create_client_sync(
    url="file:local.db"
)
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>

You don't need to provide an `authToken` in development.

</Info>

<Info>

It's recommended to use environment variables for both `url` and `authToken` for a seamless developer experience.

</Info>

## Turso CLI

If you're using [libSQL](/libsql) specific features like [extensions](/libsql#extensions), you should use the Turso CLI:

```bash
turso dev
```

This will start a local libSQL server and create a database for you. You can then connect to it using the `url` option in your SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```ts JavaScript
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
});
```

```rust Rust
let client = libsql_client::Client::from_config(libsql_client::Config {
    url: url::Url::parse("http://127.0.0.1:8080").unwrap(),
    auth_token: None,
})
.await
.unwrap();
```

```python Python
import libsql_client

client = libsql_client.create_client_sync(
    url="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
)
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Warning>

Changes will be lost when you stop the server.

</Warning>

If you want to persist changes, or use a production dump, you can pass the `--db-file` flag with the name of the SQLite file:

```bash
turso dev --db-file local.db
```

## libSQL Server

You can build and run libSQL server (`sqld`) yourself locally, or inside your own infrastructure using the source code:

<Card

  icon="github"
  href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql"
/>

</CardGroup>

## Turso Database

If you already have a database created with Turso, you can use that same one in development by passing the `url` option to your SDK.

<Warning>

Keep in mind that using the Turso hosted database will incur platform costs and count towards your quota. Consider using [SQLite](#sqlite) or [Turso CLI](#turso-cli) for local development to avoid platform costs.

</Warning>

## Connecting a GUI

During development you can easily connect to a SQLite, libSQL, or Turso database using one of the tools below:

- [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/db/libsql-client/) &mdash; macOS, Linux, and Windows
- [Outerbase](https://www.outerbase.com) &mdash; Runs in the browser
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com) &mdash; macOS, Windows, and Linux
- [Dataflare](https://dataflare.app) &mdash; Paid (with limited free version) macOS, Windows, and Linux
- [libSQL Studio](https://github.com/invisal/libsql-studio) - Runs in the browser
