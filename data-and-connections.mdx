Turso, an extension of [libSQL](/libsql) (a SQLite fork), modifies the consistency model due to its network-accessible and replicated nature, deviating from SQLite's strictly serializable standard.

Database operations begin with a client establishing either an [HTTP or websocket connection](/sdk/connecting) to a server instance. Following this, an internal SQLite database connection is set up within the server to facilitate the operations.

Database operations are tightly controlled to maintain order and data integrity, with primary instances handling all writes in a serialized manner and replicas managing local reads.

- **On the primary database:**

  - All operations are linearizable, forming an ordered history.
  - Writes are fully serialized; other writes wait for a transaction to complete.
  - Caution with long-running or abandoned transactions as they block other writes.

- **On the replicas:**

  - Writes are forwarded to the primary and applied there.
  - Changes from the primary are eventually pulled by each replica (200-300ms latency).
  - No guarantees on the time for replicas to reflect primary's changes.
  - Reads are local and not globally ordered; data might differ across replicas.
  - Monotonic reads are maintained, ensuring that any read operation will not return data older than previously read data on the same instance.

- **Transactional consistency**:

  - Transactions in libSQL, both batch and interactive, adhere to SQLite's transaction semantics.
  - Transactions in libSQL provide snapshot isolation for read operations and immediate visibility of writes to the same process, ensuring serializability and isolation from other transactions.

## Scale to zero

Turso automatically scales to zero databases for free users after one hour of inactivity. Databases will automatically scale to one once a request is invoked. There could be a delay of up to `500ms` for inactive database groups.

<Info>

Databases with extended inactivity (**10 days**) will require a manual wake operation using the [CLI](/cli/group/wakeup) or API.
