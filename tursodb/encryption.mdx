Turso Database provides native encryption for data at rest using industry-standard AEAD algorithms. Each database page is encrypted individually, ensuring data integrity and security across all environments.

- **Page-level encryption**: Each 4 KiB page is encrypted individually with a unique nonce
- **AEAD algorithms**: Support for AEGIS-256 (fast, modern) and AES-GCM (NIST-approved)
- **Data integrity**: Built-in authentication tags prevent tampering and corruption
- **High performance**: As little as 6% read overhead and 14% write overhead
- **In-memory keys**: Encryption keys are never stored on disk

Turso Database with encryption is perfect for:

## What's Encrypted

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Encrypted" icon="lock">
    - All database pages with your data - The database file - Write-Ahead Log
    (WAL) file
  </Card>
  <Card title="Not Encrypted" icon="lock-open">
    - The database header (first 100 bytes)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Generate an Encryption Key

First, generate a secure 32-byte encryption key in hexadecimal format:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

This will output a key similar to:

```
2d7a30108d3eb3e45c90a732041fe54778bdcf707c76749fab7da335d1b39c1d
```

<Warning>
  **Store your key securely!** If you lose the encryption key, you will not be
  able to access your encrypted database. Keys are never stored on disk.
</Warning>

## Create an Encrypted Database

<Steps>

<Step title="Launch with encryption">

Use the `--experimental-encryption` flag and specify your cipher and key in the connection URI:

```bash
tursodb --experimental-encryption "file:encrypted.db?cipher=aegis256&hexkey=YOUR_HEX_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_HEX_KEY` with the key you generated above.

</Step>

<Step title="Create and insert data">

Once in the interactive shell, create a table and insert some data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE secrets (id INT, data TEXT);
INSERT INTO secrets VALUES (1, 'sensitive information');
INSERT INTO secrets VALUES (2, 'confidential data');
```

</Step>

<Step title="Verify encryption">

Exit the shell (type `.quit`) and try to open the database without the key:

```bash
tursodb encrypted.db
```

You won't be able to access the data. The database is encrypted on disk.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Open an Encrypted Database

To access an existing encrypted database, provide the same cipher and key used during creation:

```bash
tursodb --experimental-encryption "file:encrypted.db?cipher=aegis256&hexkey=YOUR_HEX_KEY"
```

Then query your data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM secrets;
```

## Supported Ciphers

Turso Database supports two AEAD encryption algorithms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AEGIS-256" icon="bolt">
    **Recommended for most use cases**

    - Extremely fast performance
    - Modern cryptographic design
    - Better security features

    ```
    cipher=aegis256
    ```

  </Card>

  <Card title="AES-GCM" icon="shield-check">
    **For compliance requirements**

    - NIST-approved standard
    - Widely supported
    - Industry standard

    ```
    cipher=aesgcm256
    ```

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## URI Parameters

When creating or opening an encrypted database, use the following URI format:

```
file:database.db?cipher=CIPHER&hexkey=HEX_KEY
```

| Parameter | Required | Description                          | Values                  |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `cipher`  | Yes      | Encryption algorithm                 | `aegis256`, `aesgcm256` |
| `hexkey`  | Yes      | 32-byte encryption key in hex format | 64-character hex string |

## Performance

Encryption overhead is minimal, especially for smaller databases:

- **Read operations**: ~6% overhead with AEGIS-256
- **Write operations**: ~14% overhead with AEGIS-256
- **Overall**: ~1-3% total time overhead for mixed workloads

For detailed benchmarks, see the [encryption announcement blog post](https://turso.tech/blog/introducing-fast-native-encryption-in-turso-database).

## Coming Soon

Future encryption features in development:

- **Key derivation from passphrases**: Use memorable passphrases instead of raw keys
- **Encrypt existing databases**: Migrate unencrypted databases to encrypted format
- **Key rotation**: Update encryption keys without data loss
- **`ATTACH` support**: Work with multiple encrypted databases simultaneously
