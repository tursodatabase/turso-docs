---

The following runtime environments are known to be compatible:

- Node.js version 12 or later
- Deno
- CloudFlare Workers
- Netlify & Vercel Edge Functions

<Info>

The JavaScript SDK comes with TypeScript bindings and supports environments where either language can be used. Both ESM and CJS modules are provided.

</Info>

## Installing

<Snippet file="install-libsql-client-ts.mdx" />

## Initializing

Import `createClient` to initialize a client that you can use to query your database:

<Snippet file="configure-libsql-client-ts.mdx" />

<br />

<Info>

If you're using libsql locally or an sqlite file, you can ignore passing `authToken`.

</Info>

## In-Memory Databases

libSQL supports connecting to [in-memory databases](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) for cases where you don't require persistence:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: ":memory:",
});
```

## Local Development

You can work locally using an SQLite file and passing the path to `createClient`:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "file:path/to/db-file.db",
  authToken: "...",
});
```

<Warning>

The `@libsql/client/web` does not support local file URLs.

</Warning>

## Embedded Replicas

You can work with embedded replicas by passing your Turso Database URL to `syncUrl`:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "file:path/to/db-file.db",
  syncUrl: "libsql://[databaseName]-[organizationSlug].turso.io",
  authToken: "...",
});
```

<Snippet file="embedded-replicas-warning.mdx" />

### Manual Sync

The `sync()` function allows you to sync manually the local database with the remote counterpart:

```ts
await client.sync();
```

### Periodic Sync

You can automatically sync at intervals by configuring the `syncInterval` (seconds) property when instantiating a new libSQL client:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "file:path/to/db-file.db",
  syncUrl: "libsql://[databaseName]-[organizationSlug].turso.io",
  syncInterval: 60,
  authToken: "...",
});
```

## Encryption

To enable encryption on a SQLite file, pass the `encryptionKey`:

<Snippet file="encryption-at-rest-typescript.mdx" />

Encrypted databases appear as raw data and cannot be read as standard SQLite databases. You must use the libSQL client for any operations &mdash; [learn more](/libsql#encryption-at-rest).

## Response

Each method listed below returns a `Promise<ResultSet>`:

| Property          | Type                          | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rows`            | `Array<Row>`                  | An array of Row objects containing the row values, empty for write operations                                      |
| `columns`         | `Array<string>`               | An array of strings with the names of the columns in the order they appear in each Row, empty for write operations |
| `rowsAffected`    | `number`                      | The number of rows affected by a write statement, `0` otherwise                                                    |
| `lastInsertRowid` | `bigint         \| undefined` | The ID of a newly inserted row, or `undefined` if there is none for the statement                                  |

## Simple query

You can pass a string or object to `execute()` to invoke a SQL statement:

<CodeGroup>

```ts String
const result = await client.execute("SELECT * FROM users");
```

```ts Object
const result = await client.execute({
  sql: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  args: [1],
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Placeholders

libSQL supports the use of positional and named placeholders within SQL statements:

<CodeGroup>

```ts Positional
const result = await client.execute({
  sql: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  args: [1],
});

const result = await client.batch(
  [
    {
      sql: "INSERT INTO users VALUES (?)",
      args: ["Iku"],
    },
  ],
  "write",
);
```

```ts Named
const result = await client.execute({
  sql: "INSERT INTO users VALUES (:name)",
  args: { name: "Iku" },
});

const result = await client.batch(
  [
    {
      sql: "INSERT INTO users VALUES (:name)",
      args: { name: "Iku" },
    },
  ],
  "write",
);
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>

libSQL supports the same named placeholder characters as SQLite &mdash; `:`, `@` and `$`.

</Info>

## Transaction Modes

| Mode       | SQLite command               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `write`    | `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`            | The transaction may execute statements that read and write data. Write transactions executed on a replica are forwarded to the primary instance, and can't operate in parallel.                    |
| `read`     | `BEGIN TRANSACTION READONLY` | The transaction may only execute statements that read data (select). Read transactions can occur on replicas, and can operate in parallel with other read transactions.                            |
| `deferred` | `BEGIN DEFERRED`             | The transaction starts in read mode, then changes to write as soon as a write statement is executed. This mode change may fail if there is a write transaction currently executing on the primary. |

## Batch Transactions

A batch consists of multiple SQL statements executed sequentially within an implicit transaction. The backend handles the transaction: success commits all changes, while any failure results in a full rollback with no modifications.

```ts
const result = await client.batch(
  [
    {
      sql: "INSERT INTO users VALUES (?)",
      args: ["Iku"],
    },
    {
      sql: "INSERT INTO users VALUES (?)",
      args: ["Iku 2"],
    },
  ],
  "write",
);
```

## Interactive Transactions

Interactive transactions in SQLite ensure the consistency of a series of read and write operations within a transaction's scope. These transactions give you control over when to commit or roll back changes, isolating them from other client activity.

| Method       | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `execute()`  | Similar to `execute()` except within the context of the transaction |
| `commit()`   | Commits all write statements in the transaction                     |
| `rollback()` | Rolls back the entire transaction                                   |
| `close()`    | Immediately stops the transaction                                   |

<CodeGroup>

```ts Rollback Usage
try {
  const userId = "user123";
  const withdrawalAmount = 500;

  const transaction = await client.transaction("write");

  const balanceResult = await transaction.execute({
    sql: "SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE userId = ?",
    args: [userId],
  });

  const currentBalance = balanceResult.rows[0]["balance"] as number;

  if (currentBalance >= withdrawalAmount) {
    await transaction.execute({
      sql: "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE userId = ?",
      args: [withdrawalAmount, userId],
    });
  } else {
    console.log("Insufficient funds");
    await transaction.rollback();
    return;
  }

  await transaction.commit();
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

```ts Batch Usage
try {
  const records = [
    { name: "Alice", age: 30 },
    { name: "Bob", age: 25 },
    { name: "Charlie", age: 35 },
  ];

  const transaction = await client.transaction("write");

  for (const record of records) {
    await transaction.execute({
      sql: "INSERT INTO people (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)",
      args: [record.name, record.age],
    });
  }

  await transaction.commit();
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
  await transaction.rollback();
}
```

```ts Conditional Usage
try {
  const productId = "prod456";
  const newPrice = 150;

  const transaction = await client.transaction("write");

  const productResult = await transaction.execute({
    sql: "SELECT price FROM products WHERE productId = ?",
    args: [productId],
  });

  const currentPrice = productResult.rows[0]["price"] as number;

  if (currentPrice > newPrice) {
    await transaction.execute({
      sql: "UPDATE products SET price = ? WHERE productId = ?",
      args: [newPrice, productId],
    });
  } else {
    console.log("New price is not lower than current price");
    await transaction.rollback();
    return;
  }

  await transaction.commit();
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Interactive transactions in libSQL lock the database for writing until
  committed or rolled back, with a 5-second timeout. They can impact performance
  on high-latency or busy databases.
</Warning>

## ATTACH

You can attach multiple databases to the current connection using the `ATTACH` attachment:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: process.env.TURSO_DATABASE_URL,
  authToken: process.env.TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN,
});

const txn = await db.transaction("read");

await txn.execute('ATTACH "<database-id>" AS attached');

const rs = await txn.execute("SELECT * FROM attached.users");
```

<Info>
  Make sure to [allow `ATTACH`](/cli/db/config/attach/allow) and create a token
  with the permission to attach a database &mdash; [learn
  more](/features/attach-database)
