description: Get started with Turso and TypeScript using the libSQL client in a few simple steps
---

In this JavaScript quickstart we will learn how to:

- Retrieve database credentials
- Install the JavaScript libSQL client
- Connect to a remote Turso database
- Execute a query using SQL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve database credentials">

You will need an existing database to continue. If you don't have one, [create one](/quickstart).

<Snippet file="retrieve-database-credentials.mdx" />

<Info>You will want to store these as environment variables.</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install @libsql/client">

<Snippet file="install-libsql-client-ts.mdx" />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize a new client">
    Next add your database URL and auth token:

<Snippet file="configure-libsql-client-ts.mdx" />

  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute a query using SQL">

You can execute a SQL query against your existing database by calling `execute()`:

```ts
await turso.execute("SELECT * FROM users");
```

If you need to use placeholders for values, you can do that:

<CodeGroup>

```ts Positional
await turso.execute({
  sql: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  args: [1],
});
```

```ts Named
await turso.execute({
  sql: "INSERT INTO users VALUES (:name)",
  args: { name: "Iku" },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>
