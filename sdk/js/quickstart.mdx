description: Get started with Turso and JavaScript using the LibSQL client in a few simple steps
---

In this JavaScript quickstart we will learn how to:

- Install the JavaScript LibSQL client
- Connect to a remote Turso database
- Execute a query using SQL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install @libsql/client">

First begin by installing the `@libsql/client`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @libsql/client
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @libsql/client
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @libsql/client
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize a new client">
    Next add your database URL and auth token:

<CodeGroup>

```ts Node.js
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "libsql://",
  authToken: "...",
});
```

```ts Edge Runtimes
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client/web";

const client = createClient({
  url: "libsql://",
  authToken: "...",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also connect to a local SQLite file by passing `file:` instead of a URL when using Node.js, [learn

  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute a query using SQL">

You can execute a SQL query against your existing database by calling `execute()`:

```ts
const result = await client.execute("SELECT * FROM users");
```

If you need to use placeholders for values, you can do that:

<CodeGroup>

```ts Positional
const result = await client.execute({
  sql: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  args: [1],
});
```

```ts Named
const result = await client.execute({
  sql: "INSERT INTO users VALUES (:name)",
  args: { name: "Iku" },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>
