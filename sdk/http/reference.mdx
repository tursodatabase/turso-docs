Turso Databases can be accessed via HTTP. The API enable developers to perform SQL operations using the [Hrana over HTTP](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/docs/HTTP_V2_SPEC.md) protocol, retrieve server version information, and monitor the health status.

<Info>

It's recommended you use a [native SDK](/sdk).

</Info>

## Base URL

Simply replace your database URL protocol `libsql://` with `https://`:

```bash
https://[databaseName]-[organizationName].turso.io
```

You can obtain your database base URL from the Turso CLI:

<Accordion title="Obtain HTTP URL using Turso CLI">

```bash
turso db show [databaseName] --http-url
```

</Accordion>

## Authentication

Turso uses Bearer authentication, and requires your API token to be passed with all protected requests in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
```

<Accordion title="Create token using Turso CLI">

```bash
turso db tokens create [databaseName]
```

</Accordion>

## Endpoints

Your database has the endpoints available below:

### `POST /v2/pipeline`

You can use the `/v2/pipeline` endpoint to query a database. The endpoint accepts a series of operations to perform against a database connection. The supported operation types are:

- `execute`: execute a statement on the connection.
- `close`: close the connection.

#### Simple query

<CodeGroup>

```json Request
{
  "requests": [
    { "type": "execute", "stmt": { "sql": "CREATE TABLE users (name)" } },
    { "type": "close" }
  ]
}
```

```json Response
{
  "baton": null,
  "base_url": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "ok",
      "response": {
        "type": "execute",
        "result": {
          "cols": [],
          "rows": [],
          "affected_row_count": 0,
          "last_insert_rowid": null,
          "replication_index": "1"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "ok",
      "response": {
        "type": "close"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>

Connections are left open until they timeout, unless you close them explicitly in the request (as shown above). Every request made on a connection bumps the timeout. You should close the connection when it's no longer needed.

</Info>

#### Interactive query

Sometimes, it may be desirable to perform multiple operation on the same connection, in multiple roundtrips. We can do this by not closing the connection right away:

<CodeGroup>

```json Body
{
  "requests": [{ "type": "execute", "stmt": { "sql": "BEGIN" } }]
}
```

```json Response
{
  "baton": "m7lVVgEvknpf1P1irxHsHqrAqH7BLiwO4DQIAwr93PdZWGvdBNugLSokSsCZNkry",
  "base_url": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "ok",
      "response": {
        "type": "execute",
        "result": {
          "cols": [],
          "rows": [],
          "affected_row_count": 0,
          "last_insert_rowid": null,
          "replication_index": "1"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

We can see that we have received a `baton` back. This is because we haven't closed the connection. We can now use this baton to perform more queries on the same connection:

```json Body
{
  "baton": "m7lVVgEvknpf1P1irxHsHqrAqH7BLiwO4DQIAwr93PdZWGvdBNugLSokSsCZNkry",
  "requests": [
    { "type": "execute", "stmt": { "sql": "CREATE TABLE users (name)" } },
    {
      "type": "execute",
      "stmt": { "sql": "INSERT INTO users VALUES (\"iku\")" }
    },
    { "type": "execute", "stmt": { "sql": "COMMIT" } },
    { "type": "close" }
  ]
}
```

<Info>

Note that both transactions and connections have timeouts. Transaction have a 5 seconds window to complete, while connections get closed after 10 seconds of idle time.

#### Response types

The response from Hrana contains the following fields:

| Field      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `baton`    | string | The baton is used to identify a connection with the server so that it can be reused.                                                 |
| `base_url` | string | The base URL of the server that handled the request. This URL can be reused for subsequent requests to force routing to that server. |
| `results`  | array  | The results for each of the requests made in the pipeline.                                                                           |

The `results` array contains the results for each of the requests made in the pipeline. Each result has the following fields:

| Field                | Type    | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cols`               | array   | The list of columns for the returned rows.                  |
| `rows`               | array   | The rows returned for the query.                            |
| `affected_row_count` | integer | The number of rows affected by the query.                   |
| `last_insert_rowid`  | integer | The ID of the last inserted row.                            |
| `replication_index`  | string  | The replication timestamp at which this query was executed. |

### `GET /version`

To obtain the current version of the server running your database you can use the `/version` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Request
curl -L -X GET 'https://[databaseName]-[organizationName].turso.io/version' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
```

```text 200
sqld 0.21.9 (67f3ea5d 2023-10-26)
```

</CodeGroup>

### `GET /health`

To check the health of your database, you can use the `/health` endpoint which returns an empty body with an HTTP status:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Request
curl -L -X GET 'https://[databaseName]-[organizationName].turso.io/health' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN'
```

```text 200
This response has no body data.
```
