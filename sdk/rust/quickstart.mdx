sidebarTitle: Quickstart
description: Get started with Turso and Rust using the libSQL client in a few simple steps
---

In this Rust quickstart we will learn how to:

- Retrieve database credentials
- Install the Rust libSQL client
- Connect to a remote Turso database
- Execute a query using SQL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve database credentials">

You will need an existing database to continue. If you don't have one, [create one](/quickstart).

<Snippet file="retrieve-database-credentials.mdx" />

<Info>You will want to store these as environment variables.</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install libsql-client">

First begin by installing the `libsql-client` [crate](https://crates.io/crates/libsql-client):

```bash
cargo add libsql-client
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set environment variables">
    Next export your `LIBSQL_CLIENT_URL` and `LIBSQL_CLIENT_TOKEN`:

    ```bash
      export LIBSQL_CLIENT_URL="libsql://"
      export LIBSQL_CLIENT_TOKEN="..."
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize a new client">

Next initialize a new `db` client using `libsql_client`:

```rust
let db = libsql_client::Client::from_config(libsql_client::Config {
  url: url::Url::parse("libsql://").unwrap(),
  auth_token: None,
})
.await
.unwrap();
```

You can also connect to a local SQLite file by passing `file:` path instead, [learn
more](/sdk/rust/local-development).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a query using SQL">

You can execute a SQL query against your existing database by calling `execute()`:

```rust
let result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM users").await?;
```

If you need to use placeholders for values, you can do that:

```rust
use libsql_client::{Statement, args};

let result = client.execute(Statement::with_args(
  "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
  args!(1),
))
.await?;
```

  </Step>
</Steps>
