</Note>

In this Flutter/Dart quickstart we will learn how to:

- Retrieve database credentials
- Install the Flutter/Dart libSQL client
- Connect to a local or remote Turso database
- Execute a query using SQL
- Sync changes to local database (optional)

<Steps>

  <Step title="Retrieve database credentials">

You will need an existing database to continue. If you don't have one, [create one](/quickstart).

<Snippet file="retrieve-database-credentials.mdx" />
<Info>You will want to store these as environment variables.</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install libsql_dart">

```bash
flutter pub add libsql_dart
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize">

Now connect to your local or remote database using the `LibsqlClient` constructor:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Embedded Replicas">
    ```dart
    final dir = await getApplicationCacheDirectory();
    final path = '${dir.path}/local.db';

    final client = LibsqlClient(path)
      ..authToken = '<TOKEN>'
      ..syncUrl = '<TURSO_OR_LIBSQL_URL>'
      ..syncIntervalSeconds = 5
      ..readYourWrites = true;
    ```

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Local only">

  <CodeGroup>
      ```dart File
      final dir = await getApplicationCacheDirectory();
      final path = '${dir.path}/local.db';

      final client = LibsqlClient(path);
      ```

      ```dart In-Memory
      final client = LibsqlClient(":memory:");
      ```

  </CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remote only">
    ```dart
    final client = LibsqlClient('<TURSO_OR_LIBSQL_URL>')
      ..authToken = '<TOKEN>';
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Connect">

```dart
await client.connect();
```

</Step>

  <Step title="Execute">

<CodeGroup>

```dart Execute
await client.execute("create table if not exists customers (id integer primary key, name text);");
```

```dart Insert
await client.query("insert into customers(name) values ('John Doe')");
```

```dart Select
print(await client.query("select * from customers"));
```

```dart Batch
await client.batch("""insert into customers (name) values ('Jane Doe'); insert into customers (name) values ('Jake Doe');""");
```

```dart Prepared statement
final statement = await client
	.prepare("select * from customers where id = ?");

await statement.query(positional: [1])
```

```dart Interactive transaction
final tx = await client.transaction();

await tx
	.execute("update customers set name = 'John Noe' where id = 1");
await tx
	.execute("update customers set name = 'Jane Noe' where id = 2");
print(await tx
	.query("select * from customers where id = ?", positional: [1]));

await tx.commit();
```

</CodeGroup>

If you need to use placeholders for values, you can do that:

<CodeGroup>

```dart Positional
final statement = await client
  .prepare("select * from customers where id = ?");

await statement.query(positional: [1])
```

```dart Named
final statement = await client
	.prepare("select * from customers where id = :id");

await statement.query(named: {"id": 1})
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync (Embedded Replicas only)">

When using embedded replicas you should call `sync()` on the connector to sync your local database with the primary database.

```dart
await client.sync();
```

  </Step>

</Steps>
