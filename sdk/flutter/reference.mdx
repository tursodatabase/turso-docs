libSQL Flutter / Dart Reference

The libSQL package for Flutter / Dart contains everything you need to work with Turso / libSQL and works flawlessly with all features, because it’s build on top libSQL Rust crate and `flutter_rust_bridge` package, allowing for seamless communication between Rust and Dart.

## Add the package to your project

```bash
flutter pub add libsql_dart
```

Alternatively, manually add it to your project's `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
libsql_dart:
```

## Initializing

Call `LibsqlClient` constructor to create the database client. Different configurations are supported, allowing connection to in-memory database, local sqlite file, remote Turso / libSQL database, or embedded replica.

## In-Memory Databases

libSQL supports connecting to [in-memory databases](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) for cases where you don't require persistence:

```dart
final client = LibsqlClient(":memory:");
```

## Local Development

You can work locally using an SQLite file and passing the path to `LibsqlClient`:

```dart
final dir = await getApplicationCacheDirectory();
final path = '${dir.path}/local.db';

final client = LibsqlClient(path);
```

## Remote

You can work with remote database by passing your Turso Database URL:

```dart
final client = LibsqlClient('<TURSO_OR_LIBSQL_URL>')
	..authToken = '<TOKEN>';
```

## Embedded Replicas

You can work with embedded replicas by passing your Turso Database URL to `syncUrl`:

```dart
final dir = await getApplicationCacheDirectory();
final path = '${dir.path}/local.db';

final client = LibsqlClient(path)
	..authToken = '<TOKEN>'
	..syncUrl = '<TURSO_OR_LIBSQL_URL>'
	..readYourWrites = true;
```

<Snippet file="embedded-replicas-warning.mdx" />

### Connect

```dart
await client.connect();
```

### Manual Sync

The `sync()` function allows you to sync manually the local database with the remote counterpart:

```ts
await client.sync();
```

### Periodic Sync

You can automatically sync at intervals by configuring the `syncIntervalSeconds` property when instantiating the client:

```dart
final dir = await getApplicationCacheDirectory();
final path = '${dir.path}/local.db';

final client = LibsqlClient(path)
	..authToken = '<TOKEN>'
	..syncUrl = '<TURSO_OR_LIBSQL_URL>'
	..syncIntervalSeconds = 5
	..readYourWrites = true;
```

## Encryption

To enable encryption on a SQLite file, pass the `encryptionKey`:

```dart
final dir = await getApplicationCacheDirectory();
final path = '${dir.path}/local.db';

final client = LibsqlClient(path)..encryptionKey = '<KEY>';
```

Encrypted databases appear as raw data and cannot be read as standard SQLite databases. You must use the libSQL client for any operations &mdash; [learn more](/libsql#encryption-at-rest).

## Execute

Returns number of rows affected:

```dart
await client.execute("create table if not exists customers (id integer primary key, name text);");
```

## Query

Returns rows as `List<Map<String, dynamic>>`. Will returns empty list when is not performing select query:

```dart
await client.query("insert into customers(name) values ('John Doe')");

print(await client.query("select * from customers"));
```

## Placeholders

libSQL supports the use of positional and named placeholders within SQL statements:

<CodeGroup>

```dart Positional
final statement = await client
	.prepare("select * from customers where id = ?");
await statement.query(positional: [1])
```

```dart Positional
final statement = await client
	.prepare("select * from customers where id = :id");
await statement.query(named: {"id": 1})
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Info>

libSQL supports the same named placeholder characters as SQLite &mdash; `:`, `@` and `$`.

</Info>

## Batch Transactions

A batch consists of multiple SQL statements executed sequentially within an implicit transaction. The backend handles the transaction: success commits all changes, while any failure results in a full rollback with no modifications.

```dart
await client.batch("""insert into customers (name) values ('Jane Doe'); insert into customers (name) values ('Jake Doe');""");
```

## Transaction Modes

| Mode                                  | SQLite command               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LibsqlTransactionBehavior.immediate` | `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`            | The transaction may execute statements that read and write data. Write transactions executed on a replica are forwarded to the primary instance, and can't operate in parallel.                    |
| `LibsqlTransactionBehavior.readOnly`  | `BEGIN TRANSACTION READONLY` | The transaction may only execute statements that read data (select). Read transactions can occur on replicas, and can operate in parallel with other read transactions.                            |
| `LibsqlTransactionBehavior.deferred_` | `BEGIN DEFERRED`             | The transaction starts in read mode, then changes to write as soon as a write statement is executed. This mode change may fail if there is a write transaction currently executing on the primary. |

## Interactive Transactions

Interactive transactions in SQLite ensure the consistency of a series of read and write operations within a transaction's scope. These transactions give you control over when to commit or roll back changes, isolating them from other client activity.

| Method       | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `execute()`  | Similar to `execute()` except within the context of the transaction |
| `query()`    | Similar to `query()` except within the context of the transaction   |
| `commit()`   | Commits all write statements in the transaction                     |
| `rollback()` | Rolls back the entire transaction                                   |

```dart
final tx = await client.transaction();
await tx
	.execute("update customers set name = 'John Noe' where id = 1");
await tx
	.execute("update customers set name = 'Jane Noe' where id = 2");
print(await tx
	.query("select * from customers where id = ?", positional: [1]));
await tx.commit();
```

<br />

<Warning>
  Interactive transactions in libSQL lock the database for writing until
  committed or rolled back, with a 5-second timeout. They can impact performance
  on high-latency or busy databases.
</Warning>

## Attach

You can attach multiple databases to the current connection using the `ATTACH` attachment:

```dart
final tx = await client.transaction(behavior: LibsqlTransactionBehavior.readOnly);
await tx.execute("ATTACH "<database-id>" AS attached");
print(await tx.execute("SELECT * FROM attached.customers"));
await tx.commit();
```

<Info>
  Make sure to [allow `ATTACH`](/cli/db/config/attach/allow) and create a token
  with the permission to attach a database &mdash; [learn
