sidebarTitle: Quickstart
description: Get started with Turso and Swift using the libSQL client in a few simple steps.
---

In this Swift quickstart we will learn how to:

- Retrieve database credentials
- Install the libSQL package
- Connect to a local or remote Turso database
- Execute a query using SQL
- Sync changes to local database (optional)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Retrieve database credentials">

    You will need an existing database to continue. If you don't have one, [create one](/quickstart).

    <Snippet file="retrieve-database-credentials.mdx" />

    <Info>You will want to store these as environment variables.</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install">

    First begin by adding `libsql` as a package dependency in XCode using this repo:
    <https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-swift>

    Or add it to your SwiftPM dependencies:

    ```swift
    import PackageDescription

    let package = Package(
        // ...
        dependencies: [
            .package(url: "https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-swift", from: "0.1.1"),
        ],
        // ...
    )
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect">

You must first create a `Database` object and then open a `Connection` to it:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Embedded Replicas">

```swift
import Libsql

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Local only">

```swift
import Libsql

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remote only">

```swift
import Libsql

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute">

You can execute a SQL query against your existing database by calling `query()`,
or `execute()` when you expect the query to not yield any rows:

```swift
let rows = try conn.query("SELECT * FROM users")
```

If you need to use placeholders for values, you can do that:

<CodeGroup>

```swift Positional Query
try conn.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1)
```

```swift Positional Insert
try conn.execute("INSERT INTO users (id) VALUES (?)", 1)
```

<Note>
Named arguments are not supported yet.
</Note>

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync (Embedded Replicas only)">

When using embedded replicas you should call `sync()` on the database type to
sync your local database with the primary database, unless you are using
`sync_interval` (though there is no issue with calling `sync` with
`sync_interval` enabled):

```swift
try db.sync()
```

  </Step>
</Steps>
