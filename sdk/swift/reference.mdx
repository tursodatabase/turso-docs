title: Turso Reference (Swift)
---

The libSQL Rust crate contains everything you need to work with Turso and works flawlessly with popular async runtimes like `tokio`.

## Installing

First begin by adding `libsql` as a package dependency in XCode using this repo:
<https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-swift>

Or add it to your SwiftPM dependencies:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    // ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-swift", from: "0.1.0"),
    ],
    // ...
)
```

## In-Memory Databases

libSQL supports connecting to [in-memory databases](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) for cases where you don't require persistence:

```swift
import Libsql

let db = Libsql.Database(":memory:")
let conn = try db.connect()
```

## Local Development

You can work locally using an SQLite file using `new_local`:

```swift
import Libsql

let db = Libsql.Database("local.db")
let conn = try db.connect()
```

## Embedded Replicas

You can work with embedded replicas using `new_remote_replica` that can sync from the remote URL and delegate writes to the remote primary database:

```swift
import Libsql

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

### Manual Sync

The `sync` function allows you to sync manually the local database with the remote counterpart:

```swift
try db.sync() // Call sync manually to update local database
```

<Info>

If you require full control over how frames get from your instance of `sqld`
(libSQL Server), you can do this using `new_local_replica` and `sync_frames`.
Reach out to us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/turso) if you want to learn
more.

### Sync Interval

The `sync_interval` function allows you to set an interval for automatic
synchronization of the database in the background:

```swift
import Libsql

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>,
    sync_interval: 300 // Sync every 5 minutes
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

### Read Your Own Writes

The `read_your_writes` function configures the database connection to ensure
that writes are immediately visible to subsequent read operations initiated by
the same connection. This is **enabled by default**, and is particularly
important in distributed systems to ensure consistency from the perspective of
the writing process.

You can disable this behavior by passing `false` to the function:

```swift
import Libsql

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>,
    read_your_writes: false
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

## Simple query

You can pass a string to `query()` to invoke a SQL statement, as well as
optional arguments:

<CodeGroup>

```swift Execute
try conn.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (?)", 1)
```

```swift Query
try conn.query("SELECT * FROM users")
```

```swift Arguments
try conn.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Prepared Statements

You can prepare a cached statement using `prepare()` and then execute it with `query()`:

```swift
let stmt = try conn.prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?")
stmt.bind(stmt)
stmt.query()
```

## Placeholders

libSQL supports the use of positional and named placeholders within SQL statements:

```swift Positional
try conn.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1)
```

<Note>
Named arguments are not supported yet.

<Note>
Batch execute and transaction are not supported yet.
