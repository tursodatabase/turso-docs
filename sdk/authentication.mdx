title: Authentication
---

SDKs connect to Turso using the `libsql://` protocol, unless using the [HTTP API](/sdk/http).

## Database URL

You can find your database URL using the [Turso CLI](/cli/db/show) or [Platform API](/api-reference/databases/retrieve), it looks something like this:

<CodeGroup>

```bash libSQL
libsql://[DB-NAME]-[ORG-NAME].turso.io
```

```bash HTTPS
https://[DB-NAME]-[ORG-NAME].turso.io
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>

WebSockets generally offer better performance when maintaining an open socket for multiple queries, whereas HTTP is typically more efficient for single queries due to reduced client-server round trips &mdash; it's advisable to benchmark both to ascertain the best option for your specific needs.

## Auth Tokens

SDKs require an auth token, unless [working locally](/local-development). You can create tokens using the [Turso CLI](/cli) or [Platform API](/api-reference), or let your authentication provider issue tokens via [JWKS](/sdk/authorization#jwks-authentication-providers).

See [Authorization](/sdk/authorization) for full details on token creation, fine-grained permissions, and JWKS setup.
