Turso uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authorization to control access to your databases. You can create tokens with different scopes and fine-grained permissions to restrict what operations each client can perform.

There are two ways to issue JWT tokens for database access:

- **[Platform Tokens](/sdk/authorization/tokens)** — Create tokens directly via the Turso CLI or Platform API.
- **[External Auth Providers](/sdk/authorization/jwks)** — Let your authentication provider (e.g., Clerk, Auth0) issue tokens using JWKS.

Both approaches support [fine-grained permissions](/sdk/authorization/fine-grained-permissions) to control access at the table and action level.

All tokens are passed as the `authToken` when creating a database client:

```javascript
import { createClient } from "@tursodatabase/serverless";

const db = createClient({
  url: "<your-database-url>",
  authToken: "<your-token>",
});
```

<Note>
  You can get your database URL with `turso db show <database-name> --url`.
